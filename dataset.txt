Why I chose these datasets:

These datasets contain information about Google and Apple's opening, closing, highest, and lowest daily stock prices over several years. I chose these datasets because they include data for the years 2015-2020.

I have the flexibility to compare how Apple and Google's stock values changed over the same day, week, year, or five-year period. I am still determining the period I will highlight in my plots. 

In addition, I will compare Apple and Google's stock prices against each other to investigate which company performs better on the stock market.
